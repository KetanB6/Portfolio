                <p>
                    Hello! I'm a BCA student pursuing degree in college of computer science and information <br>
                    technology, latur and will graduate in 2026, with a strong foundation in Java, C, and C++.<br> 
                    My primary focus is on Java development, and I’m currently advancing my skills<br> 
                    by learning various frameworks like spring, hibernate, etc. and advanced Java<br> 
                    topics to build powerful applications.<br><br>
                    
                    I have worked on data structures and algorithms (DSA) and solving daily problems<br> 
                    for building logic and developed projects like hotel management, student management system<br>
                    with library management,and a real-time traffic signal simulation.<br> 
                    I enjoy writing clean, efficient code which is easy to get fro everyone and solving complex problems<br> 
                    and learn from them.<br><br>

                    Beyond coding, I believe in continuous learning, meaningful connections, and personal growth.<br>
                    I'm excited to explore new technologies and create impactful software.<br>

                </p>

                    <p>
                        <h2>○ C</h2>
                        I started with C, which helped me build a strong foundation in coding and helped<br>
                        me to build m logic in programing. i solved many problems in C, and also cleared three<br>
                        rounds of blind coding competition organized by our college in my first year.<br><br>

                        <h2>○ C++</h2>
                        Strong foundation in C helped me a lot in learning and mastering C++, i developed<br>
                        my first console based project i.e. Hotel management system with lots of perations <br>
                        which i added below is developed C++ programming language with OPP. <br><br>

                        <h2>○ HTML, CSS & JavaScript</h2>
                        I have fundamental knowleadge in HTML and CSS and will master these languages,<br>
                        these languages are the reasons of my intrest building in programming and software development.<br>
                        I learned these skills in my 11th and 12th, and with that foundation i build this portfolio website.

                        <h2>○ Java</h2>
                        After building strong foundation in C++ and OPP, i learned Java and build strong<br>
                        foundation in it and currently learning advanced topics and various frameworks of Java<br>
                        for creating various UI based projects. I developed console based Students Management System<br>
                        project in Java.

                        <h2>○ SQL</h2>
                        As SQL is important language to communicate with data in data base and building various <br>
                        projects, i learned basic SQL.

                    <h2>○ Hotel Management System </h2>
                    I developed a Hotel Management System in C++ that efficiently handles various<br>
                    reception-related operations, such as guest management and room management. <br>
                    The program provides an instructions to perform hotel operations.
                    <br><br>
                    Key Features
                    <br><br>
                    1. Available Rooms<br>
                       Displays a list of available rooms along with their price/rent.<br><br>

                    2. Room Booking<br>
                       Allows new bookings and generates a receipt upon successful reservation.<br><br>

                    3. Cancel Room<br>
                       Enables guests to cancel their booking, but they must do so within 15 seconds<br><br>
                       of receipt generation.<br>

                    4. Departure<br>
                       Manages guest check-out and updates room availability accordingly.<br><br>

                    5. Assigned Room List<br>
                       Displays all rooms along with their current status: booked, canceled,<br>
                       or checked out.<br><br>
                    Developing this project significantly enhanced my problem-solving skills,<br> 
                    logical thinking, and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. It also provided<br>
                    valuable experience in designing structured and efficient programs.

                        <h2>○ Student Management System </h2>
                        I developed a console-based Student Management System in Core Java to efficiently<br>
                        manage student details in schools and colleges. This system handles student records,<br>
                        fee management, attendance, exam reports, and library operations.<br><br>

                        Key Features<br><br>

                        <font color = "gray">Student Management</font><br>

                        1. Fee Structure – Displays the fee details for students.<br>

                        2. Add Student – Registers a new student.<br>

                        3. Show All Students – Lists all students in the selected department.<br>

                        4. Search Student – Finds a student using their roll number.<br>

                        5. Attendance Records – Maintains student attendance.<br>

                        6. Update Student Info – Allows modifications to student details.<br>

                        7. Due Fee Payment – Tracks and processes pending fees.<br>

                        8. Exam Report – Stores and displays student marks.<br><br>

                        <font color = "gray">Library Management</font><br>

                        1. Add Book – Adds new books to the library.<br>

                        2. Search Book – Finds books using keywords or IDs.<br>

                        3. Lend Book – Issues books to students.<br>
                        <br>
                        The library and student management systems are interconnected—students can use <br>
                        their roll numbers to borrow books, ensuring seamless integration between both<br>
                        modules.<br><br>
                        This project helped me understand how enterprise software works and how different<br>
                        modules within a system can be efficiently developed and connected.
