                <p>
                    Hello! I'm a BCA student pursuing degree in college of computer science and information <br>
                    technology, latur and will graduate in 2026, with a strong foundation in Java, C, and C++.<br> 
                    My primary focus is on Java development, and I’m currently advancing my skills<br> 
                    by learning various frameworks like spring, hibernate, etc. and advanced Java<br> 
                    topics to build powerful applications.<br><br>
                    
                    I have worked on data structures and algorithms (DSA) and solving daily problems<br> 
                    for building logic and developed projects like hotel management, student management system<br>
                    with library management,and a real-time traffic signal simulation.<br> 
                    I enjoy writing clean, efficient code which is easy to get fro everyone and solving complex problems<br> 
                    and learn from them.<br><br>

                    Beyond coding, I believe in continuous learning, meaningful connections, and personal growth.<br>
                    I'm excited to explore new technologies and create impactful software.<br>

                    <p>
                        <h2>C</h2>
                        I started with C, which helped me build a strong foundation in coding and helped<br>
                        me to build m logic in programing. i solved many problems in C, and also cleared three<br>
                        rounds of blind coding competition organized by our college in my first year.<br><br>

                        <h2>C++</h2>
                        Strong foundation in C helped me a lot in learning and mastering C++, i developed<br>
                        my first console based project i.e. Hotel management system with lots of perations <br>
                        which i added below is developed C++ programming language with OPP. <br><br>

                        <h2>HTML, CSS & JavaScript</h2>
                        I have fundamental knowleadge in HTML and CSS and will master these languages,<br>
                        these languages are the reasons of my intrest building in programming and software development.<br>
                        I learned these skills in my 11th and 12th, and with that foundation i build this portfolio website.

                        <h2>Java</h2>
                        After building strong foundation in C++ and OPP, i learned Java and build strong<br>
                        foundation in it and currently learning advanced topics and various frameworks of Java<br>
                        for creating various UI based projects in it. I developed console Students Management System<br>
                        project in Java.

                        <h2>SQL</h2>
                        As SQL is important language to communicate with data in data base and building various <br>
                        projects, i learned basic SQL.
